1) Initiating Control
  Every attack sequence starts by running instructions within the web browser.  Thus, the browser must execute instructions under your control.
    Exs: XSS, etc.

2) Retaining
  Now that you've successfully attacked, how do you increase your control over the target?

  Remember, users may quickly disappear by simply closing a tab.
    Thus, instead of launching additional attacks, it's wise to be patient and instead consider methods of increasing influence over the browser.

    At this overall stage, you're attempting to reduce the potential of losing control of the browser.
      This can be achieved in several ways at different levels of persistence.

      The next stage, 3, is attacking.  However, in that stage, you might find a way to increase the retaining phase (which could help the attacking phase more).  Look at the cost/benefits and pivot to the stage that is the most helpful.

3) Attacking
  Many attacks need you to bypass the SOP
  Leverage the control you've gained and explore the attack possibilities from the present position.

  Types of attacks:
    Local and Remote

    Local
      Against the browser instance or the operating system on which it resides

    Remote
      Other systems in arbitrary positions

  Attacks in this stage may feed off of each other. Ex: Attacking plugins may show an ability to attack a network, etc.

  Attack vectors
    Users
    Browsers
    Extensions
      (If you can't attack the browser)
    Plugins
    Web Applications
    Networks
