Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs)
  Low-level modules
  Allow for many different server architectures
  Only one MPM module can be utilized for a given server
    Ex: 
      threaded mpms
        ex: worker/event
          good for sites that need large scalability
      non/threaded mpms
        ex: prefork
          good for sites that need stability and compatibility with legacy software
  Responsible for
    binding to network ports on the machine
    accepting requests
      spawning children to handle these requests

  Implementing MPMs
    Default on *nix
      event mpm
        The vast majority of time

  Ways that an MPM can be implemented
    Static Module
      compiled into the server
      $ httpd -l
        To see all modules that are compiled into the server
      
    DSO module
      Dynamic
        Allows for the MPMs to be easily "swapped out"
      Ex loading in httpd.conf
        LoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so

  event mpm
    Designed to allow more requests to be served simultaneously by passing off some processing work to the listener threads
      This frees up the worker threads to serve new requests
    Problems that this module aims to solve
      "keep alive problem" in HTTP
        After a client completes the first request, it can keep the connection open, sending further requests using the same socket
          Pros
            This saves significant overhead in creating TCP connections
          Cons
            Apache traditionally keeps an entire process/thread waiting for data from the client
              This consumes valuable resources
              Ex: The worker mpm reserves one worker thread per connection

        Solving the problem
          dedicated listener thread
            the event mpm uses a dedicated listener thread for each process
              This handles
                The listening sockets
                All sockets that are in the "Keep alive" state
                Sockets where the handler and protocol filters have done their work
                Sockets where the only remaining action item is to send the data to the client

    vs worker mpm
      The event mpm is based on the worker mpm
      worker mpm
        implements a hybrid multi-process multi-threaded server.
          A single control process (the parent) is responsible for launching child processes
            Child processes
              ThreadsPerChild dir
                Each child creates a fixed number of server threads as specified in the dir.
              Have a listener thread which listens for connections and passes those connections off to a worker thread for processing once they arrive
    vs previous mpms
      Async connections
        General Idea
          Allow you to process a single HTTP request using non-blocking I/O and depending on the implementation, in separate threads
        Unlike previous MPMs, the event mpm don't need a fixed dedicated worker thread

        CURRENTLY AT: 
          http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/event.html
            A similar restriction is currently present for requests involving an output filter that needs to read and/or modify the whole response body

            After I'm done reading this, go back to http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mpm.html and look for any links that I didn't read
